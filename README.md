# PIC32Reach #

Blink five LEDs on a PIC32MX550F256L dev board from Reach Robotics.
Millisecond timer interrupt generated by Timer 1.
Also sends characters to all five USARTs,
generates PWM on OC1 and OC2,
and accepts analog input from a pot on AN6.
Two SPI channels configured to send data, SPI2 at 2MHz and SPI3 at 1MHz.
SPI2 sends a 16-bit word every 22.6us (44.1kHz).
SPI3 sends variable-length packets at certain times in the main loop.

PIC32 pin numbers are for the 100-pin package.

LEDs light when the pin is pulled LOW.

## PIC32 Toolchain ##

MPLAB X V5.20 and 'xc32' V2.15.
These are quite old versions now, so I really ought to upgrade!

## PIC32 Programmer ##

Microchip ICD3.
Other programmers should work, e.g. ICD4 or PICkit4.
